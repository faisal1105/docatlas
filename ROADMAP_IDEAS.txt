DocAtlas Roadmap Ideas
======================

- Add a "simple mode" that skips content analysis and sorts files using only
  filename and file type (extension).
- In simple mode, run a routine check to sort; sorting rules are defined by the
  user (like Application + Categories).
- Include folder size reporting and an optional delete action.
- Add a dedicated "Unreadable" bucket for low/no-text files.
